## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher) OR Docker and Docker Compose
- Discord Bot Token
- CoinGecko API (free, no API key required)

### Option 1: Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd crypto-discord
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the bot**
   - Create a Discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Create a bot and copy the token
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
     ```

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Invite the bot to your server**
   - Use the OAuth2 URL generator in the Discord Developer Portal
   - Select "bot" scope and "Send Messages" and "Use Slash Commands" permissions
   - Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

6. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Option 2: Docker Installation (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd crypto-discord
   ```

2. **Configure the bot**
   - Create a Discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Create a bot and copy the token
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
     ```

3. **Invite the bot to your server**
   - Use the OAuth2 URL generator in the Discord Developer Portal

   - Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

4. **Run with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   The bot will automatically:
   - Build the Docker image
   - Start the container in the background
   - Restart automatically if it crashes
   - Persist portfolio data in `portfolio.json`

## Data Storage

The bot uses a simple JSON file (`portfolio.json`) to store portfolio data. Each entry includes:
- Cryptocurrency symbol
- Purchase price
- Quantity purchased
- Purchase date
- User ID (for multi-user support)

**Note**: When using Docker, the `portfolio.json` file is mounted as a volume to persist data between container restarts.

## API Integration

The bot uses the **CoinGecko API** to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices. This API is free and doesn't require an API key, making it perfect for this project.

## Development

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev:watch

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Docker Development
```bash
# Build and run in development mode
docker-compose up --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop and remove containers
docker-compose down
```
